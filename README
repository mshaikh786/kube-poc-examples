Kubeflow first pass. Notebook, pipeline examples and Katib example are included

Pre-requisites:
  Need to have a Docker machine to build an image
  Credentials (sent separately in a private email)

First create a JupyterLab enabled container image for Kubeflow. 

$ cd jupyterlab_kf/jupyter
$ NB_USER=training## NB_UID=880### make docker-build

Push the resulting image namely, jupyter:training## to hub.docker.com

This can then be pulled in Kubeflow's UI when starting an interactive session.
